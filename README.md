# LGBT_Survey_SentimentalAnalysis

### Topic : Survey on fundamental rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in EU (2012)

### Introduction
The last few years have been marked by a growing wave of hatred around the world, accompanied by the rise of conservatism. One of the main social groups affected by this phenomenon is LGBTQI +, which has been fighting for rights and inclusion for years; Recent achievements such as the legalization of the LGBT civil union throughout the United States represent a major achievement in the midst of this scenario, but the situation has not always been that way.

With this in mind, I use data from the European Union in 2012 to analyze aspects such as the influence of discrimination on personal life, as well as the relationship between a country's HDI and the welfare of that group.

### Questions to the dataset
- What is the influence of the Human Development Index (HDI) on the quality of life of LGBTs? 
- Does this social minority benefit from less discrimination and more rights in countries with higher HDI?
- Does sexism influence men to have less acceptance of sexuality compared to women? 
- Is this more noticeable among bisexual men?

### Data Used
The main database used for this analysis was taken from https://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/survey-fundamental-rights-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and and contains data from countries belonging to the European Union and Croatia in 2012. The basis for this was obtained after a survey, for which a series of questions about LGBT welfare, discrimination and violence were conducted. The questions also consider subgroups within LGBTs and separation by country of origin.

It was also used the base available at http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506 to obtain the HDI of each of the countries present in the research.

### Conclusion

Linear regression shows me that a country's human development index is a good indicator of the well-being of the LGBT population. This may be due to the fact that inhabitants of countries with higher HDI have more access to education, besides having a larger number of laws that guarantee the rights of this social minority.

However, the classifier did not show promising results regarding the fact that bisexual men had less acceptance about sexuality. Therefore, it is possible that there is no major influence of machismo in this group, but it is also possible that the available data are insufficient to support this hypothesis.
